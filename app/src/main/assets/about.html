    <p>It began with the forging of the Great Rings.</p>
    <p>Three were given to the Elves,</p>
    <p>immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.</p>
    <p>Seven to the Dwarf-Lords,</p>
    <p>great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.</p>
    <p>And nine, nine rings were</p>
    <p>gifted to the race of Men,</p>
    <p>who above all else desire power.</p>
    <p>For within these rings was bound the strength</p>
    <p>and the will to govern each race.</p>
    <p>But they were all of them deceived,</p>
    <p>for another ring was made.</p>
    <p>Deep in the land of Mordor, in the Fires of Mount</p>
    <p>Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged a master ring,</p>
    <p>and into this ring he poured his cruelty,</p>
    <p>his malice and his will to dominate all life.</p>
